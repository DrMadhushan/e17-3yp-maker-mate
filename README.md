# Maker Mate

[TOC]

## Overview
For this project specific case, Maker Mate enables the lab users to apply for the project/ experiment requirements online and collect tools and equipment accordingly from an automated vending machine while the lab admin can manage the entire inventory online with ease. Maker Mate can take similar role but for different use case on demand.

## Introduction
Maker Mate is a vending system which assits the Maker Space in computer engineering department. It is a vending system with an information console.It shows the details about the tools and equipments in the labrotary. The vending machine is used to lend and return the labrotary tools for students for their projectsa and experiments. The Maker Mate provide 24 hour service to the students and admins as will make it online throgh and mobile app. The administrators could be able to manage the inventory through this system more efficiently and in real time.

## Goals
* Creating a fully functional inventory management system for the Maker Space.
* Developing 2 types of sample lockers which can be accessed by authorization. 
* Developing a user interface to communicate with the maker vending system and control it.
